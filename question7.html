        <p>Muslims believe that Ramadan or the ninth month of the Islamic Calendar is the month in which God revealed the 
            first verses of the Quran to Muhammad, 
            who is considered the final prophet of Islam. So for 30 days, those who observe fast from dawn to dusk. </p>

         <p>  NISA MUHAMMAD: No food. No water. And it's just an exciting time to have a reset, so to speak. </p> 
            
         <p> LEILA FADEL, HOST:
            
            Nisa Muhammad is the assistant dean for religious life at Howard University. 
            She says Ramadan is a time to focus on family, prayer and gratitude for all that you have. </p>
            
          <p>  MUHAMMAD: While we are fasting from food and drink, there are people who have to fast from food and drink all the time.
             They don't have access to food. They don't have access to clean water. 
            And so during this process, God wants us to understand, you know, what it means to be hungry, what it means to be thirsty.</p>
