        <h3 class="history"><strong>April Showers Bring May Flowers: A History</strong></h3>
        <p>The poem as we know it today originated all the way in 1157, in the form of a short poem written by 
            Thomas Tusser. The poem can be found in the April section of a collection of his writings titled. "<em>A Hundred Good
                Points of Husbandry."
            </em>"<strong>The poem goes as follows</strong>
        </p>
        <p>"Sweet April showers Do spring May flowers"</p>
        <p>While this poem is clearly a direct ancestor to the version we know today, letâ€™s travel back in time a 
            bit further to the end of the Fourteenth Century, 
            where legendary poem Geoffrey Chaucer had his own say on the month of April in his famous collection of stories titled,
        <em>"The Canterbury Tales."</em>  </p>
