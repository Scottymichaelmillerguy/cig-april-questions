        <h3 class="history"><strong>April Showers Bring May Flowers: A History</strong></h3>
        <p>The poem as we know it today originated all the way in 1157, in the form of a short poem written by 
            Thomas Tusser. The poem can be found in the April section of a collection of his writings titled. "<em>A Hundred Good
                Points of Husbandry."
            </em>"<strong>The poem goes as follows</strong>
        </p>
        <p>"Sweet April showers Do spring May flowers"</p>
        <p>While this poem is clearly a direct ancestor to the version we know today, let’s travel back in time a 
            bit further to the end of the Fourteenth Century, 
            where legendary poem Geoffrey Chaucer had his own say on the month of April in his famous collection of stories titled,
        <em>"The Canterbury Tales."</em> <strong>Caucer's version goes as follows:</strong> </p>
        <h4>Original:</h4>
        <p>“Whan that Aprill, with his shoures soote
            The droghte of March hath perced to the roote
            And bathed every veyne in swich licour,
            Of which vertu engendred is the flour;”</p>

        <h4>Translation:</h4>
        <p>When in April the sweet showers fall
            That pierce March’s drought to the root and all
            And bathed every vein in liquor that has power
            To generate therein and sire the flower;”</p>
