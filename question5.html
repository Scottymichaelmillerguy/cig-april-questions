        <p>Unlike the Gregorian calendars that start the year on Jan. 1, most South Asian countries use lunisolar calendars that start 
            the year at the beginning of spring. Some of the countries that use this system include <strong>Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, 
                Thailand, and Cambodia</strong>. </p>
        <h3>How did the traditions come about?</h3>
        <p>In Nepal, the New Year is known as Navavarsha. Nepal has its own official calendar that begins on the first day of the first month
             — Baisakh. </p>
        <p>In Bangladesh, the Bengali New Year, or Pohela Boishakh, falls on April 14. Pohela Boishakh is celebrated in both Bangladesh and West 
            Bengal, and in Bengali communities in Assam and Tripura in India.</p>
        <p>In Sri Lanka, people celebrate the Sinhala New Year, or Aluth Avurudu. It marks the end of the harvest season and also coincides with 
            one of two instances when the sun is directly above Sri Lanka. </p>
        <p>People in Thailand celebrate their traditional New Year, called Songkran, which takes place from April 13 to April 15. Songkran falls 
            during the hottest time of the year in Thailand. The temperatures can rise above 100°F. Derived from the Sanskrit language, the word songkran means “to pass or move into.”</p>
