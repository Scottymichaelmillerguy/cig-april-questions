        <h3>#8 on 11 April Festivals around the world. This Dutch national holiday pays tribute to
             King Willem-Alexander on his birthday, a tradition that dates back to the late 19th century. 
             Amsterdam pretty much becomes a three-day party! Locals sport orange in honor of ruling family, 
             the House of Orange-Nassau, and take to the streets-and the canals-for parades and celebrations as 
             well as to snack on tompouce, a local pastry. This year's festivities take place April 26 - 29.
